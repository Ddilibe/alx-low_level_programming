Question: Have you ever wondered how it was possible to pass multiple argument in a function? Have you ever wondered how gcc works? 
	Well, worry no More. This repo expalins clearly all you need to know when it comes to argument counts and argument vectors


argc stands for "Argument count". This contains the number of argument passed to a program
argv stands for "Argument vector". A vector is a one dimensional array. argv is also a one dimentional array of strings. Each string is one of the argument that was passed to the program.
