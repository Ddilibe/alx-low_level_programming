# Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure in which keys are mapped to array positions by a hash function. A hash function is a mathematical formula which when applied to a key produces an integer which can be used as an index for the key in the hash table. The main part of a hash function is that elements should be relatively, randomly and unoformly distributed. It produces a unique set of integers within some suitable range in order to reduce the number of collision. In practice, no hash function can e,iminate collision completely. A good hash function can only minimize the number of collision bty spreading the elements uniform ly throughout the array
